todo overall data check for services
especially preset name length
name length
authorised user pin length + only digits? + if supervisior pin is set then resetting is not allowed, test reset
supervisior pin length + only digits? + only allowed if authorised user pin is set, test reset

todo check pin settings after set (single/multi changed, not none)

disable settings entities if only allowed to control

return meaningful errors if authentication fails or only authenticated for control but try to change settings



atm it doesn't support not setting any pin and just read data 




# todo width input is not validated

# todo authentication does not take into account that sometimes control user (authorised user) is also allowed to change more settings

# todo setup enabled/disabled change multi pin settings depending on login permission
